For all SCTE projects, we strongly recommend using [serverless architecture](https://redsqwaream001.github.io/scte-website-system-integegrations-plan/Glossary#serverless-architecture).

## Why serverless?
[Serverless](https://redsqwaream001.github.io/scte-website-system-integegrations-plan/Glossary#serverless-architecture) enables you to build modern applications with increased agility and lower total cost of ownership. Building [serverless](https://redsqwaream001.github.io/scte-website-system-integegrations-plan/Glossary#serverless-architecture) applications means that your developers can focus on their core product instead of worrying about managing and operating [servers](https://redsqwaream001.github.io/scte-website-system-integegrations-plan/Glossary#server) or runtimes, either in the cloud or on-premises. This reduced overhead lets developers reclaim time and energy that can be spent on developing great products which [scale](https://redsqwaream001.github.io/scte-website-system-integegrations-plan/Glossary#scalability) and that are reliable.

## Summary
On an abstract level, we're looking at a decoupled, platform-agnostic software system that essentially is a collection of various [microservices](https://redsqwaream001.github.io/scte-website-system-integegrations-plan/Glossary#microservice) needed to fulfill business requirements.

Out of the many advantages of [microservices](https://redsqwaream001.github.io/scte-website-system-integegrations-plan/Glossary#microservice), the most significant motivations are scale and autonomy for [business units](https://redsqwaream001.github.io/scte-website-system-integegrations-plan/Glossary#business-unit). These go hand in hand.

Each service can be a standalone [microservice](https://redsqwaream001.github.io/scte-website-system-integegrations-plan/Glossary#microservice) or a collection of [FAAS](https://redsqwaream001.github.io/scte-website-system-integegrations-plan/Glossary#faas) responsible for fulfillment of [business unit](https://redsqwaream001.github.io/scte-website-system-integegrations-plan/Glossary#business-unit) for that particular service.
