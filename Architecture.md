For all SCTE projects, we strongly recommend using serverless architecture.

## Why serverless?
Serverless enables you to build modern applications with increased agility and lower total cost of ownership. Building serverless applications means that your developers can focus on their core product instead of worrying about managing and operating servers or runtimes, either in the cloud or on-premises. This reduced overhead lets developers reclaim time and energy that can be spent on developing great products which scale and that are reliable.

## Summary
On an abstract level, we're looking at a decoupled, platform-agnostic software system that essentially is a collection of various microservices needed to fulfill business requirements.

Out of the many advantages of microservices, the most significant motivations are scale and autonomy for business units. These go hand in hand.

Each service can be a standalone microservice or a collection of FAAS responsible for fulfillment of business unit for that particular service.
